# DYNAMIC LANDING PAGE


## PROJECT MOTIVATION
This project was created to demonstrate an example of an advertising dynamic landing page. The navigation menu changes dynamically so that each navigation item can simply be added to the navigation bar without manually having to write in each hyperlink into the HTML. This page has its own CSS and HTML styling created in a lake-like style and color scheme.
